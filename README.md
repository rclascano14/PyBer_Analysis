# PyBer_Analysis
`Analyzing and visualizing ride-sharing data using the power of Python, Pandas, and your newest tool, Matplotlib.`

## Resources
- Python 3.7.11
- Conda, Pandas, Numpy, ipykernal
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib

## 1. Overview of the Analysis: 
Throughout this module, we have been tasked with creating data visualizations to analyze urban, suburban and rural cities and their fare costs, their total of rides and their driver count, etc. In this pursuit, we have learned how to do all manner of plots from bar graphs, pie charts, scatter plots, etc. Having learned these useful visualization skills, we are now asked to create a summary DataFrame of the ride sharing data by city type. Afterwards, we use Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multipe-graph lines that allows us to see total weekly fares in each city type. Now, with this third deliverable, I will summarize and show how the data is different with rach city type as well as how we can use these discrepancies in decision making. 
## 2. Results:

- Urban cities have by far the most rides, drivers and total fares. This is followed by Suburban cities and Rural cities come in last with by far the least total amount of rides, drivers and fares. 
- Conversely, likely due to distance and small numbers, Rural cities have the largest Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver. In opposite order from my last point, Suburban cities come in the middle and Urban cities come in last with the cheapest fare averages for both rides and drivers.
  
## 3. Summary:
With the overview and results having been layed out, I will now proceed to offer three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. 
- Urban cities certainly deal with the most traffic and obstacles, so a way to decrease the discepancies among average fare per drivers and average fare per ride is to charge more in urban cities as a way of addressing these issues experienced heavily among Urban cities. 
- Rural Cities have 78 drivers to 125 rides, Suburban Cities have 490 drivers to 625 rides, and Urban Cities have 2405 drivers for 1625 rides. Thismeans that some urban drivers are not getting any rides. If any of these drivers live in a rural or suburban city, it would help the disparities in this data by relocating their services to the type of city they reside in. 
- Another alternative is for these urban drivers to relocate to other types of cities during months in which, the other cities are more in need of a driver.
